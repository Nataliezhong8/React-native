#### Introduction: This is my running steps to implement barcode scanning using react-native (using windows10)

### 1. Create a project
1.1 Open cmd and create a project in a specific directory
```
react-native init BarcodeScanner
```
1.2 Go into your project directory and download the reactive-native-camera library
```
npm install react-native-camera@https://github.com/lwansbrough/react-native-camera.git --save
```
1.3 Link it to our scanner application.
```
react-native link react-native-camera
```
